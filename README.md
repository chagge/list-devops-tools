DevOps tools
============

A curated list of development and operational tools for Unix-like operating
systems.

## Databases

* **[SquirrelSQL](http://squirrel-sql.sourceforge.net/)**: Multi-database
  graphical SQL client. Supports anything JDBC supports (MySQL, Postgres,
  MSSQL, etc).


## Dev stubbing

* **[fakesmtp](http://nilhcem.com/FakeSMTP/index.html)**: a Fake SMTP Server
  with GUI for testing emails in applications easily.


## Linting

* **[httpolice](https://github.com/vfaronov/httpolice)**: a validator for HTTP
  requests and responses. It can spot bad header syntax, inappropriate status
  codes, and other interoperability problems in your HTTP server or client.


## Networking

* **[mtr](https://www.bitwizard.nl/mtr/)**: My TraceRoute. combines the
  functionality of the 'traceroute' and 'ping' programs in a single network
  diagnostic tool.
* **[netcat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netcat)**: a computer networking
  utility for reading from and writing to network connections using TCP or
  UDP. Replacement for telnet. Can also act as a server.
* **[sshuttle](https://github.com/apenwarr/sshuttle)**: Sshutle is VPN over
  SSH without requiring a remote VPN server or admin rights. Instead, it
  builds up an ssh session and than locally forwards traffic over it by
  creating local PREROUTING firewall rules.
* **[stunnel](https://www.stunnel.org/)**: a proxy designed to add TLS
  encryption functionality to existing clients and servers without any changes
  in the programs' code.
* **[tcptraceroute](https://linux.die.net/man/1/tcptraceroute)**: A traceroute
  implementation using TCP packets
* **[wavemon](https://github.com/uoaerg/wavemon)**: an ncurses-based
  monitoring application for wireless network devices.
* **[rinetd](https://www.boutell.com/rinetd/)**: Redirects TCP connections
  from one IP address and port to another. 


## Monitoring

* **[monit](https://mmonit.com/monit/)**: a small utility for managing and
  monitoring Unix systems. Monit conducts automatic maintenance and repair and
  can execute meaningful causal actions in error situations.
* **[iotop](http://guichaz.free.fr/iotop/)**: Show disk and swap I/O per
  process.


## Security

* **[fail2ban](https://www.fail2ban.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page)**: Fail2ban
  scans log files and bans IPs that show the malicious signs.
* **[fern](http://ferm.foo-projects.org/)**:  a tool to maintain complex
  firewalls, without having the trouble to rewrite the complex rules over and
  over again. 
* **[testssl](https://testssl.sh/)**: checks a server's service on any port
  for the support of TLS/SSL ciphers, protocols as well as recent
  cryptographic flaws and more. 


## Source control

* **[tig](https://github.com/jonas/tig)**: an ncurses-based text-mode
  interface for git.
* **[git cola](https://git-cola.github.io/)**: a sleek and powerful graphical
  user interface for Git.
* **[multi-git-status](https://github.com/fboender/multi-git-status)**: Show
